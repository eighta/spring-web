	<!-- TODO-01: Deploy this application to the server. Access the home page 
		at http://localhost:8080/webflow-getting-started. Remove any previously deployed 
		applications from your server to allow for faster startup. A New Reward link 
		has been added to the options at the bottom of each page. Clicking it generates 
		a 404. The next few labs will implement it. -->

	<!-- TODO-02: Set up a Webflow executor bean called "flowExecutor". Use 
		the default configuration (no properties). You will probably need to refer 
		to the course notes to do these TO DO steps. -->

	<!-- TODO-03: Create a flow registry bean with no properties - for now. -->

	<!-- TODO-04: Setup the correct handler adapter and mapper setting their 
		properties. -->

	<!-- TODO-05: You will want your new mapper to be used first, so its order 
		property must also be set. If you look in mvc-config.xml, you won't see any 
		handler adapters because they are automatically setup for you by <mvc:annotation-driven> 
		starting from order 0. To make your new handler the first in the chain, use 
		a value less than zero such as -1. -->

	<!-- TODO-06: Create a new directory: WEB-INF/rewards/newReward and create 
		a new flow there called newReward-flow.xml. A template (empty-flow.xml) is 
		provided for you at the top-level of this project. Copy its contents into 
		your new XML file. It contains the namespace that you need. -->

	<!-- TODO-07: A flow must contain at least one state. Create a view-state 
		called "enterDiningInformation". -->

	<!-- TODO-08: Register a new flow with id "/rewards/newReward" -->

	<!-- TODO-09: Try running the application and clicking on the New Reward 
		link. You should still get a 404 but only because the "enterDiningInformation" 
		does not exist - check the console output to confirm this. -->
