          As this is an optional part of the lab, you may choose to give up now!
          </p></td></tr></table></div><p>Right-click the Insight tc Server instance in the Servers view and
        select "Open Dashboard". If the option is greyed out, you can alternatively
        open a browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/insight" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/insight</a>
        You will see the start page for Spring Insight.  If you get a 404 and errors
        in the Console view, refer to the warning below the diagram</p><!--NEW FIGURE DIV--><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" style="text-align: center"><div xmlns="" class="figure"><a name="spring-insight-trace-history"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/rewards-online/spring-insight-trace-history.jpg" align="middle" alt="Spring Insight Trace History"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.3.&nbsp;Spring Insight Trace History</b></p></div><br xmlns="" class="figure-break"></div><p>The Spring Insight dashboard presents a sequence of
        incoming application requests over a timeline. Under All Applications
        (on the left) select the name of your web application
        "/rewards-online". This will filter out requests for
        other web applications. Next, switch to the Recent Activity tab and
        see the same information as a bar chart. Move your mouse over any of
        the bars in the timeline and click it. This will show a list of traces
        corresponding to specific requests along with trace details as seen
        below:</p><!--NEW FIGURE DIV--><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" style="text-align: center"><div xmlns="" class="figure"><a name="spring-insight-trace-details"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/rewards-online/spring-insight-trace-details.jpg" align="middle" alt="Spring Insight Trace Details"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.4.&nbsp;Spring Insight Trace Details</b></p></div><br xmlns="" class="figure-break"></div><p>Select any request and examine the trace details.
        Each line in a trace detail represents an entry point into an
        application or a server component much like a stack trace in a
        debugger. Use the little arrows on the right to get more details for
        each line in the trace. You will get information about HTTP
        request/response headers, Spring MVC controller invocations, return
        values, transactional methods, JDBC queries and more. Within an
        expanded trace detail you will also see a "Go to Source" link that
        will take you directly to the source code.</p><p>Getting a break down for an individual request is very useful.
        However, at some point you will probably run a load test and will want
        to get the same information. Spring Insight is well suited for that
        because it is lightweight and doesn't alter the performance of the
        application. Return to the first tab - Browse Resources. On the left
        hand side, under All Applications you should find the current
        application - rewards-online. Click to show
        application details. You should see a screen that looks approximately
        like this:</p><!--NEW FIGURE DIV--><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" style="text-align: center"><div xmlns="" class="figure"><a name="spring-insight-endpoints"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/rewards-online/spring-insight-endpoints.jpg" align="middle" alt="Spring Insight Endpoints"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.5.&nbsp;Spring Insight Endpoints</b></p></div><br xmlns="" class="figure-break"></div><p>This is where you can get useful information after
        running a load test. What you see is a list of endpoints. An endpoint
        is a call to a server or an application component for which you want
        to aggregate statistics. For example for a given Spring MVC Controller
        you'd like to know how often it was invoked and what was the average
        response time. Click on any endpoint and see a response time
        histogram. From here you can select a specific request that took
        longer than others and examine the trace details.</p><p>Before ending the lab you will see how to turn the gathering of
        statistics with Spring Insight on and off. Double-click the Insight tc Server
        instance in the Servers View. Select the middle tab (at the bottom of
        the view).</p><!--NEW FIGURE DIV--><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" style="text-align: center"><div xmlns="" class="figure"><a name="tc-server-config-editor"></a><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/rewards-online/tc-server-config-editor.png" align="middle" alt="tc Server Configuration Editor"></div></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.6.&nbsp;tc Server Configuration Editor</b></p></div><br xmlns="" class="figure-break"></div><p>In the resulting screen you will see a section titled
        Overview with a checkbox. Use this checkbox to enable and disable the
        gathering of statistics (metrics) at any time during the class. We recommend
        that you keep it off until you need it.  If you prefer not to use Spring
        Insight, you could simply use the other (original) tc Server instance.</p></div><p>Congratulations! You have completed this lab. You should now have
      a solid understanding of the development environment, the reference application
      architecture and the functionality that must be implemented.
      You are in a great position to do the rest of the labs.</p></div></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="reference-domain.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="mvc-getting-started-lab.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Reward Dining: The Course Reference Domain&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><span style="color:white;font-size:90%;"><a href="http://www.spring.io" title="The Spring Framework">Spring By Pivotal</a></span></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;mvc-getting-started: Spring MVC for Beginners</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
