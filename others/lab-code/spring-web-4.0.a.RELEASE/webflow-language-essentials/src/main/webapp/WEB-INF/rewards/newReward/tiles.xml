	<!-- TODO-02b: You need to enter definitions for the TWO mock views provided. 
		Remember that by default a view-state called "myview" expects a view called 
		"myview" to be available. Refer to one of the other tiles.xml files if you 
		aren't sure what to do. Set the "navigationTab" attribute to "newReward". 
		Page titles can be found in messages.properties. -->
