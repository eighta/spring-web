	<!-- TODO-02a: Implement this view-state. Unless otherwise stated the files 
		you need are all in this directory: WEB-INF/rewards/newReward. A suitable 
		JSP with a mock view has been provided for you in . It needs setting up as 
		a Tile - there is an empty tiles.xml provided. Once this is working clicking 
		on New Reward should finally show a Dining Form. Now complete related steps 
		TO DO-2b and TO DO-2c. -->

	<!-- TODO-04: Finally we need to transition to an end-state once the user 
		confirms they are happy. Create the end-state now and add a suitable transition 
		into it. If you run the flow now, you should be able to run straight through 
		it but at the end, it just starts again. -->

	<!-- TODO-05: A RewardController has been provided to allow reward details 
		to be displayed. Check the code now and work out what it does and how it 
		works. From the end-state we want to see the reward just created. A redirect 
		is needed. What URL will you use? (There is only one reward in the system 
		currently, it has id 1). When the flow works it should show you a Reward 
		Details page as confirmation, and you are done! -->
