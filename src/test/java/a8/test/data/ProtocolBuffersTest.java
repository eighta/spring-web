/*
 With protocol buffers, you write a .proto description of the data 
 structure you wish to store. From that, the protocol buffer compiler 
 creates a class that implements automatic encoding and parsing of 
 the protocol buffer data with an efficient binary format. The generated 
 class provides getters and setters for the fields that make up a protocol 
 buffer and takes care of the details of reading and writing the protocol 
 buffer as a unit.
