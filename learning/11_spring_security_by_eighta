Introduction to Spring Security
-------------------------------
**Security Concepts
-Principal: User, device or system that performs an action
-Authentication: Establishing that a principal’s credentials are valid
-Authorization: Deciding if a principal is allowed to perform an action
-Secured item: Resource that is being secured

**Authentication
-There are many authentication mechanisms
 >e.g. basic, digest, form, X.509
 
-There are many storage options for credential andauthority information
 >Database, in-memory (development) , LDAP ...
 
 **Authorization
-Authorization depends on authentication
 >Before deciding if a user can perform an action, user identity must be established
 
-The decision process is often based on roles
 >ADMIN can cancel orders
 >MEMBER can place orders
 >GUEST can browse the catalog
 
 **Motivations
 -Spring Security is portable across containers
 -Separation of Concerns
 -Flexibility
 -Extensible

@Pre and @Post Annotations
--------------------------
@PreAuthorize 
@PreFilter
@PostAuthorize 
@PostFilter
 
Filtering using @PreFilter and @PostFilter
------------------------------------------
Spring Security supports filtering of collections and arrays and this can now be achieved using expressions. 
This is most commonly performed on the return value of a method. 

For example:
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")
@PostFilter("hasPermission(filterObject, 'read') or hasPermission(filterObject, 'admin')")
public List<Contact> getAll(); 

When using the @PostFilter annotation, Spring Security iterates through the returned collection and removes any 
elements for which the supplied expression is false. The name filterObject refers to the current object in the collection. 
You can also filter before the method call, using @PreFilter, though this is a less common requirement. 
The syntax is just the same, but if there is more than one argument which is a collection type then you have to select 
one by name using the filterTarget property of this annotation.

Note that filtering is obviously not a substitute for tuning your data retrieval queries. If you are filtering large 
collections and removing many of the entries then this is likely to be inefficient.
