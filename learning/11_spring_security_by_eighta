Introduction to Spring Security
-------------------------------
**Security Concepts
-Principal: User, device or system that performs an action
-Authentication: Establishing that a principalâ€™s credentials are valid
-Authorization: Deciding if a principal is allowed to perform an action
-Secured item: Resource that is being secured

**Authentication
-There are many authentication mechanisms
 >e.g. basic, digest, form, X.509
 
-There are many storage options for credential andauthority information
 >Database, in-memory (development) , LDAP ...
 
 **Authorization
-Authorization depends on authentication
 >Before deciding if a user can perform an action, user identity must be established
 
-The decision process is often based on roles
 >ADMIN can cancel orders
 >MEMBER can place orders
 >GUEST can browse the catalog
 
 **Motivations
 -Spring Security is portable across containers
 -Separation of Concerns
 -Flexibility
 -Extensible
