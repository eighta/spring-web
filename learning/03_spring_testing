spring testing
==============
Unit testing is used to test small units of code, thus its naming. Unit testing is easy to
do—not much setup is necessary, and since JUnit10 has introduced @Test annotation
writing, unit tests have become a breeze.

Integration testing is used to test bigger chunks of code made up of objects
interacting together in a given context, and the focus is set on business logic and
object integration with each other. The context is usually made up of mocks or stubs
that replace the objects, which are not the focus of the tests. You can imagine that
creating a testing context is not a simple job.

The Spring Framework includes a testing module called spring-test that makes integration testing
really practical to implement.

The SpringJUnit4ClassRunner, as the names says, is a Spring class used to tell JUnit
that the tests in this class are executed in a Spring test context.

The @ContextConfiguration receives one or more configuration files as parameters
that are used to initialize the test context.
