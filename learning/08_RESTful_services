RESTful
=======

REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.
REST is a lightweight alternative to mechanisms like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and web services (SOAP, WSDL, etc.).
REST is an architecture style for designing networked (distributed) applications. 
 The idea is that, rather than using complex mechanisms such as CORBA, RPC, or SOAP to connect machines, 
 simple HTTP is used to make calls between machines.
RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data. 
 Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (create/read/update/delete) operations.

Core REST Concepts

The REST architectural style describes six constraints:

1. Uniform interface: Defines the interface between client and server. 
Rest uses HTTP as an "application protocol", "as a platform", not just a transport protocol. 

The following HTTP specifications are used:

>>HTTP verbs are used as actions to execute on the resources 
(GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS)

(Although REST seems strongly connected to HTTP, REST principles can be followed using other protocols too,
for example: POP, IMAP, and any protocol that uses URL-like paths and supports GET and POST methods)

>>URIs are used to identify resource names. 
The resources are conceptually separate from representations. 
Representations of the resources are returned from the server to the client, 
after a client request (typically JSON or XML).

Representations contain metadata that can be used by the client to modify or
delete the resource on the server, provided it has permission to do so.

>>HTTP response: 
Response codes, the body, and headers are used to deliver state to clients. 
Clients deliver state using body content, query-string parameters,
request headers, and the URI.

2. Statelessness: The server should contain no client state. Each request has enough
context for the server to process the message. 
The URI uniquely identifies the resource, and the body contains the state (or state change) 
of that resource if the request is one that has a body (PUT, POST, PATCH). 

When working with a specific container, a session is used to preserve state 
across multiple HTTP requests. 

When using REST, there is no need for this, which increases the scalability because the
server does not have to maintain, update, or communicate the session state.

3. Client-server: A RESTful architecture is a client-server architecture, so the system
is disconnected. The server might not be available all the time, so operations are
asynchronous.

4. Cacheable: Anything returned by the server can be cached explicitly (the server
specifies conditions for caching), implicitly (the client uses its own caching
conditions), or negotiated(the client and the server negotiate caching conditions)

5. Layered system: The client cannot assume direct connection to the server.
Sometimes a requested resource can be cached, and some other unknown software
and hardware layers are interposed between the client and the server. Intermediary
servers may improve system scalability and/or security

6. Code on demand: Executable code can be transferred as a representation to the
client (usually JavaScript or compiled Java applications known as applets).

(The last constraint is optional; a REST application can be built without
code being transferred to clients, if there is no need for such operations)

The main REST HTTP methods are presented in the next Table:

HTTP	Method Purpose 		Observation
=======================================================================================================
GET 	Read 				Reads a resource; does not change it: therefore, it can be considered safe.
							Reading the same resource always returns the same result: therefore, it can
							be considered idempotent.
							
POST 	Create 				Used to create a new resource. Neither safe nor idempotent. Two identical
							POST requests will result in two identical resources being created or errors
							at application level.
							
PUT 	Update 				Most often used for update capabilities. It is not safe, because it modifies
							the state on the server, but is idempotent (unless subsequent calls of the
							same PUT request increments a counter within the resource, for example).
							
DELETE 	Delete 				Used to delete resources. Not safe, but can be considered idempotent
							because requests to delete a resource that no longer exists will always
							return a 404 (not found).

HTTP Response Codes
===================
200: Response OK (When the resource was deleted correctly)
201: When the resource was created correctly
204: When the resource is updated correctly, a 200 (OK) (or a 204 (No Content) if not returning any content in the body)
400: When a browser does not support a certain request length
404: When a resource is not found
409: When an identical resource already exists

===
When it comes to REST, everything is about resource states and transferring them between 
a client and a server, in different forms. 

The request specifies the representation type using the Accept HTTP header for GET 
and the Content-Type HTTP header for PUT and POST, because when the client is not a browser, 
the Accept header is taken into consideration.

The URI extension can be used as a representation type identifier too.

The response reports the representation type returned using the Content-Type HTTP header.

When using Spring, the representation type is specified using an attribute of the @RequestMapping annotation 
and well-known media types defined in the MediaType class:
@RequestMapping(produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)

REST Security
=============
REST services can be secured, but as the interaction between the client and server is stateless,
credentials have to be embedded in every request header. 

Basic authentication is the easiest to implement without additional libraries 
(HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, XML-DSIG, or XML-Encryption), but it guarantees
the lowest level of security. 

Basic authentication should never be used without TLS (formerly known as
SSL) encryption because the credentials can be easily decoded otherwise

Implementing REST with Spring MVC
=================================
There are multiple Java frameworks available for implementing RESTful applications: Spark, Restlet,
JAX-RS(Java EE), and RESTEasy, but Spring MVC is the easiest to use

En Spring 3.0 los metodos de los Controllers debian ser anotados con: @ResponseBody
para que la respuesta (normalmente un objeto) sea colocada en el 
Body del response

@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)
@RequestMapping(value = "/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public @ResponseBody Person getPersonById(@PathVariable Long id){
	return personManager.findById(id);
}

(behind the scenes)
HttpMessageConverters responsibility is to convert the request body to a specific class 
and back to the response body again, depending on a predefined mime type. 

By adding @EnableWebMvc respectively <mvc:annotation-driven />, spring registers a bunch of 
predefined messageconverters for JSON/XML and so on.

Every time a request is mapped to a handler method that has
parameters annotated with @RequestBody, or the method is annotated with @ResponseBody, 
Spring loops over all HttpMessageConverters

In Spring MVC 4.0 the @RestController was introduced, This annotation is conveniently annotated with
@Controller and @ResponseBody, which practically means that if you annotate a class with it, all handler
methods are transparently annotated with @ResponseBody.

Message Converters (included by default)
----------------------------------------
-StringHttpMessageConverter 
text/plain 

-MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter 
application/*+json 
Only if Jackson 2 is present on the classpath

-AtomFeedHttpMessageConverter
 application/atom+xml 
 Only if Rome is present on the classpath

-RssChannelHttpMessageConverter 
application/rss+xml 
Only if Rome is present on the classpath

-MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter 
application/*+xml 
Only if Jackson 2 is present on the classpath

REST services are used most commonly by AJAX components in a web application, and currently all
HTTP methods are supported in AJAX. But most browsers do not support any other methods besides GET
and POST in HTML forms. To use them in a form, Spring has introduced hidden methods. Basically, a
hidden input is added to a form with a regular POST method.

A filter interceptor (HiddenHttpMethodFilter) intercepts the request, 
searches for that parameter, and modifies the request accordingly before sending it to 
the appropriate handler.

NOTA IMPORTANTE: (BUG)
cuando el HiddenHttpMethodFilter se pone en marcha y hace la redireccion al metodo adecuado,
el "RequestBody" se pierde, por ejemplo al hacer un:
<sf:form method="put" ... /> con los parametros del form, al ser interceptado, 
el "RequestBody" pasa a ser NULL, toca ver que paso en el camino XXX TODO XXX

>>>Asynchronous REST Calls (ok)

@RequestMapping
Normally, void or null returning methods result in a default view name determined by the requestâ€™s path
information (from @RequestMapping annotations on the class and method).
The @ResponseStatus overrides the default behavior, causing a null ModelAndView to be used, which indicates
that the response has been handled by the controller method already. 
So, obviously the @ResponseStatus is mandatory for a RESTful handler method returning void or null.

>>>Exception Handling (ok)

>>>The 'produces' and 'consumes' Properties (ok)

>>>Asynchronous REST Services Using @Async Annotated Methods
This annotation marks a method as a candidate for asynchronous execution.
It can also be used at type level;in this case, all methods in the class are considered asynchronous.
the return type is restricted to void and Future (and implementations of this interface).

Immediately after a client calls an asynchronous method, 
the invocation returns and the execution of the method is submitted to a Spring TaskExecutor

NOTA ESPECIAL: el metodo anotado con @Async, debe estar en una clase (Bean) aparte del Caller (llamador)
de lo contrario, se ejecutara en el mismo hilo
