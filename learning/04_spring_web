==========
spring web
==========
The Spring Web MVC provides preconfigured beans for the implementation of this behavior.
These beans are contained in two main libraries:
• spring-web.jar
• spring-webmvc.jar

At the center of the Spring Web MVC framework sits the DispatcherServlet class
it acts as a front controller, an entry point for the web application.

The DispatcherServlet in Spring has the same responsibilities as the ActionServlet in Struts, 
as both are implementations of the Front Controller Pattern.

The Spring components mentioned earlier can be categorized as follows:
• Spring MVC infrastructure components
	• handler mappings
	• handler adapters
	• view resolvers
	• personalization beans
	• exception resolvers
• User-provided web components
	• handler interceptors
	• controllers
	
Configuration Without Using web.xml
===================================
Starting with Servlet 3.0+, the web.xml file is no longer needed to configure a web application. It
can be replaced with a class implementing the WebApplicationInitializer (or a class extending
any of the Spring classes that extend this interface). This class is detected automatically by
SpringServletContainerInitializer (an internal Spring supported class, which is not meant to be used
directly or extended). The SpringServletContainerInitializer class is bootstrapped automatically by any
Servlet 3.0+ container.

1: extends org.springframework.web.servlet.support.AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer
2: extends org.springframework.web.servlet.support.AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer
3: implements org.springframework.web.WebApplicationInitializer
