Spring Web Flow
===============

Spring Web Flow (SWF) is a component of the Spring Framework’s web stack that was created
to help develop complex applications by reducing the difficulty in development.

>>>support controlled page navigation and state transition; all of this adds
up to a rigorously defined conversation between the end user and the application.

Spring Web Flow brings to the possibility to define flows as separate components
detached from the rest of the implementation—web-specific classes and views.

The flow components can be defined and used similar to the way beans are used in Spring.

What Is a Flow?
A flow models the sequence of steps necessary to perform a task.

In Spring Web Flow, a flow consists of a series of steps called states. A flow will always have only one
start point and one or more end points. Leaving one state and passing into another can be restricted by the
result of a conditional expression.

Web Flow Architecture
---------------------
In Spring Web Flow, flows are defined using an XML-based flow definition language.
